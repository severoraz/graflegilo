# graflegilo
Chart reader GUI application.

Quite simply, Graflegilo will help you determine the coordinates 
of any pixel in a chart image according to the axes in it.
You will also be able to save points of interest the chart in a
chart file.

Its accuracy will depend in the rendering of the graph itself and
how you define the axes over the image.
